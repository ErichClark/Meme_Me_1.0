# Meme_Me_1.0
This app was completed as part of the coursework for the Udacity iOS Developer Nanodegree Program. 

Meme Me 1.0 is a meme generation app. It allows a user to choose an image from their Photo Library or take a new photo with their camera.
The user can then add an upper and a lower caption to complete their own meme.

The font used in Meme Me 1.0 is the popular meme font Impact. It automatically resizes as the length of captions increases.

Once the user is satisfied with their creation, they may tap the Share button and utilize the stock iOS Activity View to save or share their finished meme in a variety of ways.

Tapping Cancel at any time will reset the app to its initial state, where it displays placeholder "TOP" and "BOTTOM" captions and displays the app splash screen.

Original splash screen art provided by Udacity, upscaled and modified by Erich Clark.
